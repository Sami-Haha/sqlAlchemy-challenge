# Part 1: Analyse and Explore the Climate Data
Using sqlAlchemy and pandas analyse precipitation and temperature data for the last 12 months of the dataset in a jupyter notebook. 
I used the starter code in the downloaded challenge files as basis for jupyter notebook.  
Coding content derived from the coursework activities. 

# Part 2: Design your Climate App
Design a flask API based on the queries just developed. Coding in app.py.   
First design had all session open and close in the routes.  Redesigned to have a series of functions to complete the DRY (Don't Repeat yourself) principles.  
Unable to make the temperature data queries work using the make_query functin so I have kept the session open and close within those routes.  
Sourced stack overflow to find correct structure for the functions.   
Remainder of code sourced from course notes.
